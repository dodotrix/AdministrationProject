# Dental office administration app

This will be a learning/having fun project in which I will try to get the most out of some new technologies that I want to get familiar with. For a start I will create a basic CRUD application and then start to implement various things I will find interesting and useful for this type of app.

# Technologies

* [Angular 7](https://angular.io/)
* [ASP.NET CORE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/?view=aspnetcore-2.2#pivot=core)
* [WEB API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis)
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
